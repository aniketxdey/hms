# Computational Solutions for the Tumor Microenvironment

Tumor cells depend on a few “driver” mutations, and this “Achilles heel” can be exploited as the target of cancer therapies. 

My work at the Dietlein Lab at Harvard Medical School revolved around developing a series of computational tools for predicting transitions towards malignant genomes, as well as clinical tools
