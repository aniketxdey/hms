# Computational Solutions in the Tumor Microenvironment
## Introduction
In the context of cellular cancer proliferation, the transition from healthy cells to maligant tumor cells depends on the presence few “driver” mutations in the cancer genome. These drivers therefore serve as targets of sorts within the Tumor Microenvironment (TME), and can be exploited to produce targeted cellular therapies by combining innovations in statistics with genome biology. Specifically, a broad range of machine learning algorithms can be utilized to classify transitions between healthy and malignant phases, as well as provide predictions for future genomic events.

My research at the Dietlein Lab broadly revolved around developing a series of bioinformatics tools to interpret and visualize single cell RNA sequencing data in an effort to predict genome drivers as well as targeted compounds for treatment. The study proposed an End-to-End pipeline, which consisted of the following components consisted of the following components:

1) Creating a novel ML workflow to predict cellular transitions towards cancerous genome 

utilziing scRNAseq visualizations and clustering to predict the trajectories between 

Developing a novel ML pipeline employing a random-forest algorithm to optimize predictive completion of ligand-receptor interactions with up to 89.32% accuracy in therapeutic development simulations. 

 , as well as clinical tools that could be readily deployed in CHIP clinics. The study proposes the following:


Furthermore, our lab is committed to sharing results as user-friendly resources and software that can be run in the hands of non-computational scientists. We collaborate with scientists from other disciplines to apply bioinformatics methods to clinically focused questions.

Engineered a novel ML pipeline employing a random-forest algorithm to optimize predictive completion of ligand-receptor interactions with up to 89.32% accuracy in therapeutic development simulations. 

Then, I worked on clinical implementation of this method in 6+ drug discovery clinics at Boston Medical & UMass Memorial, & published my work in UMiami’s NSF-sponsored HRJ.
